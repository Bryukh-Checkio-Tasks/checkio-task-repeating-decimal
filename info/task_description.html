    In mathematics, a repeating decimal is a way of representing a rational number.
    A decimal representation of a number is called a repeating decimal if
    at some point there is some finite sequence of digits that is repeated infinitely.
    For example: the decimal representation of 1/3 = 0.3333333… or 0.(3) becomes periodic just after the
    decimal point, repeating the single-digit sequence "3" infinitely.
    Here is another example is 27/26 = 1.0384615384615385… or 1.0(384615), where
    the decimal becomes periodic after the second digit past the
    decimal point, repeating the sequence "384615" infinitely.
    Rational numbers are numbers which can be expressed in the form a/b where a
    and b are integers and b is not zero. This form is known as a common
    fraction. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal">Read more about this at

    You will need to convert a fraction into decimal representation.
    If the decimal is repeating, you should represent it using the brackets format seen above.
    You have a list of two integers, the first is the fractions numerator and the second is its denominator.
    For this task, you will need to return the fraction in decimal representation as a string.
